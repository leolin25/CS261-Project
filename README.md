# CS261-Project

This repository has 4 branches (main, logic, object and ui). 

- 'main' is the main branch and shouldn't be edited directly
- All the other branches are sub-branches of 'main' and so contain the same files, people should work on individual branches and commit the changes to the 'main' branch after

Whoever is working on UI has to use IntelliJ Ultimate edition (should be free if you use university email address), this is because the SwingUI designer is very easy to use in IntelliJ (drag/drop buttons) but extremely difficult to use in any other IDE. 
I would recommend everyone uses IntelliJ anyways since it is the only IDE that lets connect to Github and code on the branch, if you use another IDE you will have to copy and paste your code into the branches manually.

Entire code base should be in Java.
