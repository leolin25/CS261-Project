# CS261-Project

This repository has 4 branches (main, logic, object and ui). 

- 'main' is the main branch and shouldn't be edited directly
- All the other branches are sub-branches of 'main' and so contain the same files, people should work on individual branches and commit the changes to the 'main' branch after
